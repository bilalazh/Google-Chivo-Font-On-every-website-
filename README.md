This user style will apply the google chivo font to everything page you visit 
I have made some changes in it so websites dont break 
this will not change the following 
- monospace font
- icons --> this theme is set up to ignore icons and dont mess up icons on most websites (There were issues on some websites)


**KNOWN ISSUES**
- sometimes causes glitch like text duplication on some website when you highlight the text 
some known websites where i have seen this style glitch are 
- github 
- google collab
